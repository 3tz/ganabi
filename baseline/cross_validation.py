        training set in each pair has a size of 10. [# of Games] Must be a
        multiple of 10.

    Arguments:
        - pkl_path: str, default './data/Hanabi-Full_2_6_150.pkl'
            Path to the pickle file that contains the output generated from
            create_data.py. First 10 games are chosen for training, and the
            rest will be for validation.
        - agent: str, default 'rainbow_agent_6'
            Name of the agent to use.
        - save_pkl: boolean, default True
            If true, outputs will be saved under baseline/pkl/
        - shuffle: boolean, default True
            If true, 10 games are randomly chosen instead of simply choosing
            the first 10.
        - seed: int, default 1234
            Seed for shuffling. Use None to set current time as seed.
